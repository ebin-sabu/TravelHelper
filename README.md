# TravelHelper
An Application that Helps Users Explore New Brighton, Liverpool. Developed for IOS.

The application is designed to assist visitors to New Brighton who wish to see the murals. This app includes a map
and table and uses the user’s current location, to provide accurate location-based mural information.

The user is initially presented with a map centred on their current location and at a reasonable level of
zoom so that nearby roads etc. can be seen clearly. In portrait view, a table below the map contains a list of murals, ordered by distance from the user’s
current location (which can, of course, change as the app runs). Tapping on an annotation, or a cell, displays an image (or images) and information about a specific mural.
